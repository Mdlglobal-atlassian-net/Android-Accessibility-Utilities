# Android-Accessibility-Utilities
An Android library that aims to make the accessibility APIs less ambiguous, more streamlined, better documented, and all around better API design.

The Android Accessibility APIs are a bit confusing.  I find myself using a lot of different functions
in a lot of the different accessibility services I work on.  This repo contains (or will contain) utilties for
Accessibility Node Infos (/compat), Accessibility Services, and other Android API related classes.  

Eventually this library will also provide the "recomended" spoken string, so that Accessibility services that aim
to provide spoken feedback (like TalkBack) might fetch this information in the same way, despite providing
other features!
